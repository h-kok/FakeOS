# Fake OS Project

## Demo & Snippets

-   You can view the live version here: https://h-kok.github.io/FakeOS/

## Requirements / Purpose

-   The MVP was to create a single page application mimicking an OS of my choice, with a minimum of 3 icons displayed on the desktop.
-   The purpose of the project is to explore and consolidate understandings of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
-   Tech stack used: JavaScript, DOM, CSS/Sass, HTML

## Design Goals / Approach

-   I have mimicked a Windows95 OS using html and css and have created clickable icons using javascript and DOM manipulation to recreate some "apps" (Notepad, Solitaire, Network connection).

## Known issues

-   Refactored get date/time function to exclude DOM interaction, but now it no longer updates every minute.
-   Apps can be opened more than once, which affects the close window event listener.

## Future Goals

-   Refactor JavaScript to create one event listener for all apps.
-   Create function to bring interaction to solitaire 'app'. E.g. function on hover over image or create 'enter name' form to begin a new game.
-   Create function to bring clicked app to front.
-   Create draggable divs.

## What did you struggle with?

-   This was my first project involving DOM manuipulation, so at first I found it difficult to append elements to other dynamic elements, because I was not targeting the element correctly, however after much repetition I feel more confident about this.
