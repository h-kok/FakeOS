# Fake OS Project

The MVP was to create a single page application mimicking an OS of my choice, with a minimum of 3 icons displayed on the desktop. I have mimicked a Windows95 OS using html and css and have created clickable icons using javascript and DOM manipulation to recreate some "apps" (Notepad, Solitaire, Network connection).
